This is my project Tic Tac Toe, 
I used JavaScript to give functionality to this project
and in use with CSS and HTML I've been able to make it as a browser game.

It is a classic game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
Else if there is no winner then it is a DRAW!
